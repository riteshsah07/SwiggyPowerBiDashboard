5. Business Implications & Strategy Recommendations
✅ Customer Churn Management
Net user loss is high. Swiggy should analyze feedback and app usage patterns to identify causes.

Introduce retention campaigns such as:

Personalized discounts

Subscription models (e.g., Swiggy One)

Loyalty programs

✅ Bolt Delivery Strategy
Highlighted in dashboards, though sales from Bolt delivery are lower compared to regular orders.

Educate customers about its benefits: time savings, freshness.

Bolt can thrive in high-density cities with heavy working populations (e.g., Noida, BTM Layout).

✅ Targeted City Strategy
Focus on:

Bikaner (High rating + users)

Tirupati, Electronic City (Top sales)

Improve service in underperforming yet promising cities like Agra, Surat, and Ahmedabad using:

Local restaurant partnerships

Hyperlocal marketing campaigns

✅ Product Strategy
Veg category has wider appeal.

“Other” category may include beverages or desserts—require bundling with meals to increase sales.

✅ Youth-Centric Engagement
Age group 20–30 is dominant.

Use in-app gamification, referral bonuses, student offers, and meme marketing to drive more engagement.

6. Project Learnings
Built dynamic dashboards using Power BI filters, slicers, and custom visuals

Understood the importance of data storytelling and user experience in dashboards

Applied business intelligence to solve real-world problems

7. Conclusion
This project provided in-depth insights into Swiggy's operations. By leveraging Power BI’s analytical capabilities, we examined patterns across categories, cities, and user demographics.

The analysis reveals Swiggy’s strengths in major metro areas and its appeal to the younger audience, but also highlights concerns around customer churn and Bolt delivery underutilization.

If implemented, the strategic recommendations could boost customer retention, improve regional market share, and enhance operational efficiency.

8. Future Scope
Integrate real-time data refresh with Power BI Service

Add forecasting and predictive analytics using AI visuals

Combine with external data sources like weather or events for better demand planning
